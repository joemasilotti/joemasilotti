Hi! 👋 I'm Joe Masilotti, the Turbo Native guy. I help folks launch iOS apps in the App Store with Turbo Native and Ruby on Rails.

💻 Here are a few things I'm working on:

* [turbo-ios](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-ios) - I'm a maintainer of the Turbo Native library for iOS.
* [TurboNavigator](https://github.com/joemasilotti/TurboNavigator) - A drop-in class for Turbo Native apps to handle common navigation flows.
* [Daily Log](https://github.com/joemasilotti/daily-log) - A Rails and iOS app to track my daily habits like exercise, medication, food, and water.
* [Jumpstart Pro iOS](https://jumpstartrails.com/ios) - A template to turn your Rails app into an iOS app, powered by Turbo Native
* [RailsDevs](https://railsdevs.com) - Open source Rails app to find Ruby on Rails developers who are looking for work

👨‍💻 Here's how I can help with your Turbo Native app:

* **Zero to App Store** - I build your iOS app and launch it in the App Store.
* **Private custom workshop** - A custom workshop tailored to your team's unique needs and skill level.
* **Monthly advisory retainer** - Unlimited access to me via phone, email, and/or Zoom.
* **1:1 advisory meeting** - A one-hour video call to pick my brain.

💌 I would love to work together! [Send me an email](mailto:joe@masilotti.com) to get in touch.
