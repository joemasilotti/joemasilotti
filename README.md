Hi! 👋 I'm Joe Masilotti, an independent developer who's passionate about clean, testable code. I build, test, and deploy Ruby on Rails, Turbo (Turbolinks), and iOS apps.

👨‍💻 Here's what I can help you with:

* [Turbo(links) apps](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-ios) - Port your Ruby on Rails app to a hybrid iOS app
* Coaching - 1:1 pair programming to level up your dev skills
* Testing and development - Native iOS and/or Ruby on Rails

💻 Here's a few of the projects I'm working on:

* [Masilotti.com](https://masilotti.com) - My blog on XCTest, Turbo(links), and Ruby on Rails
* [Mugshot Bot](https://mugshotbot.com) - Automated link preview images
* [X-Wing AI](https://xwing.app) - Singple player mode for a two-player board game
