Hi! 👋 I'm Joe Masilotti, the Hotwire Native guy. I help Rails developers build web-powered iOS and Android apps with Hotwire Native.

💻 Here are a few things I'm working on:

* [Hotwire Native for iOS](https://github.com/hotwired/hotwire-native-ios) - I'm a maintainer of the Hotwire Native library for iOS.
* [Daily Log](https://github.com/joemasilotti/daily-log) - An open source Hotwire Native app to track daily exercise, medication, food, and water.
* [Jumpstart Pro iOS](https://jumpstartrails.com/ios) - A template to turn your Rails app into an iOS app, powered by Hotwire Native.
* [RailsDevs](https://railsdevs.com) - Open source Rails app to find Ruby on Rails developers who are looking for work.

👨‍💻 Here's how I can help with your Turbo Native app:

* **Zero to App Store** - I build your iOS and Android apps and launch them in the app stores.
* **Private custom workshop** - A custom workshop tailored to your team's unique needs and skill level.
* **Monthly advisory retainer** - Unlimited access to me via phone, email, and/or Zoom.
* **1:1 advisory meeting** - A one-hour video call to pick my brain.

💌 I would love to work together! [Send me an email](mailto:joe@masilotti.com) to get in touch.
